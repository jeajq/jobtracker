## Project Description
Job Tracker is a React-based web application designed to help users manage and monitor their job applications efficiently through a clean, Kanban-style interface. The system integrates with Google Firestore to enable real-time updates and persistence of user data.

The platform allows users to:
- Organise job applications into workflow stages: *Applied*, *Assessment*, *Interview*, *Offer*, and *Rejected*.
- Drag and drop job cards between columns to reflect the progress of each application.
- Search for new job opportunities using a built-in **Job Search** feature.
- Save and manage interesting job postings within the **Saved Jobs** section.
- Enjoy a modern, dark-themed interface designed for usability and clarity.

This project was developed as part of a **UTS Software Development** coursework, serving as a prototype for an application targeted at **students and early-career professionals** who need an easy way to organise and track their job search process.

The client’s goal was to create a **centralised job management system** that combines tracking, discovery, and saving of potential opportunities in one place.
